Mutex
The concepts about the mutex is much like lock. When you want to enter a room ,you must acquire the lock then 
having the permission to enter. In computer science , the mutex is used for protect critical section preventing 
other thread to mutual access the same code to avoid race condition.

Semaphore
Not like mutex either are acquired or wait to be acquire. Semaphore can set the initial value to N>1. 
We can use the value to restrict how many users in this process will be permitted to access the critical section.
